<p><strong>Important note:</strong></p>
<p>Course designers and developers must be reminded to <strong>NOT</strong> “follow blindly” the IMO Model Course in designing and developing the courses. The primary objective of the model courses is to assist in the process. The course designers and developer are free to deviate from the model course as long the international (STCW Code) and national standards and the client’s requirements are met.   </p>

<h2 id="411-course-framework">4.1.1 Course Framework</h2>
<p>Course framework is the organised plan for the whole course. It outlines, among others, what the course contains, how it is going to teach and what is the mode of assessment.</p>
<p>For courses requiring the approval of MARINA, the Course Framework is provided by them. Everything is copied in toto, except for the teaching facilities which must be tailored with what is existing in the Training Academy.</p>

<p>The scope includes the elements outlined below. It may be written in a compressed, single paragraph form or in multiple paragraphs provided that it is written clearly and concisely, providing each information in a single sentence, as possible.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Course content</strong>: 1. What is the content of the course? 2. What is the applicable STCW Table of competence and chapter?</li>
<li><strong>Course delivery</strong>: How is the course delivered and what are the teaching-learning activities?</li>
<li><strong>Learning objectives</strong>: What is the expected outcome of the course in relation to the work, career or professional development?</li>
<li><strong>Assessment</strong>: What is mode of assessment?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4112----writing-an-assessment-description">4.1.1.2    Writing an assessment description</h3>
<p>In writing assessment description in the course framework, the following must be taken into account:</p>
<ul>
<li>provides the mode and methods of assessment;</li>
<li>clear and transparent; and</li>
<li>incorporates column 4 of corresponding Table of competence in the STCW Code.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="412----course-outline-and-timetable">4.1.2.    Course Outline and Timetable</h2>
<p>Course outline provides the summary of topics contained in the course and their time allocation. For courses requiring the approval of MARINA, the course outline is already provided except for the time allocation of the assessment which is determined after the assessment design and development.</p>
<p>Course timetable is the organisation of topics according to the order of the content delivery which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>when the particular topic is to be delivered;</li>
<li>when are exercises and other classroom tasks happen; and</li>
<li>when the assessment takes place.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="413-course-syllabus">4.1.3. Course Syllabus</h2>
<p>The course syllabus captures the learning outcomes of each topic as presented in the learning outcome. It must include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Topics and the learning outcomes;</li>
<li>Reference or bibliography; and</li>
<li>Teaching aid.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="414----instructors-guide">4.1.4.    Instructor’s Guide</h2>
<p>The primary objective of the Instructor’s Guide (IG) to aid the instructor in facilitating the course by providing the teaching and learning activities (TLA). The description of modes and methods of assessment “as”, “for” and “of” learning is also provided.</p>
<p>Course designer and developer must be mindful that there are different methods and techniques for delivering the course in an effective and efficient manner. In writing the teaching and learning activities, the course developer must balance between too rigid instruction and deficient one. In other words, the IG must be specific but allows certain flexibility for the instructor.</p>

<p>The IG must be planned and laid-out in a systematic and methodological manner to ensure that when carefully followed results into an effective and efficient teaching and learning. In developing the IG, either the three phases of instruction (<strong>IBC</strong> or <strong>ABC</strong>) or the ‘<strong>Gagné’s Nine Events of Instructions</strong>’ must be used – the comparison of which is outlined below.</p>
<h4 id="ibcabc">IBC/ABC</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Introduction (Activation)</strong> - Establish the environment for learning by activating the interest of the trainees to the topic</li>
<li><strong>Body</strong> - Facilitate the learning by using different methods and techniques for teaching and learning</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong> - Provide concluding activity</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="gagnés-nine-events-of-instructions">Gagné’s Nine Events of Instructions</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Gain the attention of the trainees (students)</strong> -    Presents stimulus for learning to ensure that trainees are prepared for learning</li>
<li><strong>Inform the students of the objectives</strong> - State the learning outcomes (and, as appropriate, the assessment method)</li>
<li><strong>Stimulate recall of prior learning</strong> -    Facilitate recapitulation of prior learning and relate them to the succeeding discussion</li>
<li><strong>Present the content</strong>    - Present the topic using different methods and techniques to ensure effective learning</li>
<li><strong>Provide learning guidance</strong> -    Provide guidance for learning such as examples, case studies, concept mapping, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Elicit performance (practice)</strong>    - Allowing the trainees to process new knowledge and skills</li>
<li><strong>Provide feedback</strong>    - Provide immediate feedback</li>
<li><strong>Assess performance</strong>    - Conduct assessment (assessment ‘for’ and ‘as’ learning)</li>
<li><strong>Enhance retention and transfer to the job</strong>    - Provide concluding activity</li>

<h3 id="outcomes-based-teaching-and-learning-obtl-activities">Outcomes-Based Teaching and Learning (OBTL) Activities</h3>
<p>The following must be taken into account in writing the middle phase (or phases, in case of using the GNEI method) or instruction.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Constructive alignment</strong> must be followed in deciding what activities to conduct during instruction taking into account, first, the learning outcomes, then, the assessment method/s.</li>
<li>Activities must be appropriate based on the:<ul>
<li>Content</li>
<li>Type of learner</li>
<li>Duration</li>
<li>Availability of resources</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Activities must be learner-centred as opposed to being instructor-centred.</li>
<li>Activities must aid the learning process. Otherwise, they are just waste of time.</li>
</ul>

<li>Classroom activities – specific activities as indicated in the IG need to have an activity sheet detailing how the activity is to be conducted</li>
<li>Handouts</li>
<li>PowerPoint presentation or related material (Canva, Keynote, Prezi, Google Slides, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Instructional materials to be used for instruction must be indicated in the IG. Other IMs not listed above include:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h2 id="421----powerpoint-presentation-as-an-instructional-material">4.2.1    PowerPoint presentation as an instructional material</h2>
<p>In designing and developing PPT presentation as instructional material, the following must be taken into account:</p>
<ul>
<li>The presentation must be designed and developed to AID the delivery and to ASSIST the instructor. It must NOT be the primary source of information making the instructor redundant. It must PREVENT the instructor from just reading the slides.This can be achieved by:<ul>
<li>Avoiding text-dense slides. If the slides contained only texts, the general rule is to have 6 to 8 words per line and 4 to 6 lines per slide;</li>
<li>Long text is only appropriate when including an excerpt (whether from law, historical narrative, news clippings, etc.);</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The content on the slides must be based on the LEARNING OUTCOMES.</li>
<li>The slide must contain only ENOUGH STIMULUS for instruction. Content must be presented in a logical manner. A slide filled with unnecessary details especially if presented in illogical manner will lead the learner astray.</li>
<li>Use emphasis to highlight important contents but do it in uniform, logical manner. Use italics, bold and color. Avoid using underline.</li>
<li>Use san serif fonts such as Arial, Calibri, Tahoma and Segoe UI. Use only up to two font style. Acceptable serif fonts include Cambria and Book Antiqua. Avoid using fancy font style such as Comic Sans, Lucida Calligraphy and Vivaldi.</li>
<li>Use animation and sound sparingly and only when necessary.</li>
<li>When printed, the slide must not have overlapping content. The exception is when the slides is used EXCLUSIVELY    for self-learning and animations and overlapping contents are necessary.</li>
</ul>
