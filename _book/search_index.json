Introduction A Course Design and Development Manual prescribes the policies and procedures in the design and development of courses and training programs. Like any other manual, it must be reviewed and revised accordingly and distributed in formats suitable for the organization (although, controlled soft-copies in DOCX, PDF, WIKI, etc. is, I think, most effective). The organization needs also to have a Document Control Policies and Procedures detailing the restrictions in accessing, editing, and sharing of the document. An example of document access and restriction is shown in Table 1 below. Table 1: Document access and restrictions Sections Document classification Remarks Section 1 RESTRICTED Section 2 INTERNAL Section N PUBLIC 1.1 1.1. Definitions A list of terms used throughout the Manual must be outlined here and defined. Examples of these are defined below: Assessment program – A standardised assessment based on the STCW Table of Competences, international and national regulations or client’s requirements. Course – A structured program of learning leading to a qualification and competence. Course design and development – Systematic and cyclical process of the creation of courses from design, development, finalization, implementation and evaluation. Course package – Whole document used to conduct the course which includes the course plan, assessment tools and the instructional materials. Instructional Materials – Includes teaching aids, tools and equipment that aids in the teaching-learning activity. Outcomes-based education (OBE) – Educational approach with emphasis on the learning outcomes and student-centered approaches to teaching. Teaching approach – Broader than method, is a set of ideas on how to teach. (Strategy) Teaching method – Scientific way of presenting a subject matter. (Scientific) Teaching principles – Guiding rule in teaching. (Moral) Teaching techniques – Specific activity or style in teaching. (Style) Training program – Structured program of courses. Verb taxonomy – Classification of thinking skills (verbs) required to be demonstrated at the end of the teaching-learning activity. 1.2 1.2 Responsibilities This section must include all the people involved in the planning, designing, developing, conducting, monitoring, and evaluating the course from the management below. It must specify their duties and responsibilities in relation to the different activities contained in the manual. In addition, the job description and what this section reflects must be aligned. A few examples are as follow: 1.2.0.1 President Ensure that the provisions in this Course Design and Development Manual are enforced. Ensure that the policies and procedures contained in this manual is aligned with the organization’s vision, mission and goals. 1.2.0.2 Course developer As assigned, design and develop training courses and programs according to the policies and procedures of this manual. 1.2.0.3 Instructor As assigned, deliver the course based on the Instructor’s Guide. Conduct the course in a manner which is learner-centered and outcomes based. 1.2.0.4 Assessor As assigned, assist in the design and development of courses and training programs particularly with assessment validation and pilot testing. 1.3 1.3. Storage and Disposal of Documents The organization must have policies and procedures in placed for the retention, archiving, and disposal of records and related policies and procedures to ensure that only the approved version is being used. There must also be policies and procedures in handling documents related to the activities outlined in the manual specially those that contain confidential information. Table 2.

Course Design and Development Process 2.1 2.1. Purpose This section introduces the course design and development process and provides the general picture involved. Main phases of the design and development and the key documents to be produced are outlined. For this and the succeeding sections, it is best practice to list the targeted audience such as shown below: This section is generally helpful for the following: - Management - Course designers and developers 2.2 2.2. Conceptualising a Course There are different valid ways of which a course can be conceptualized. The table below outlines some of the approaches that any organization can use in conceptualizing a course. These approaches are non-exclusive and work best when blended, as appropriate. Table 3. Approaches to conceptualizing a course Approach Main proponents Description Client’s request Management, Marketing Specific needs of a client as learned from encounters with key personnel (e.g. Training Director/Manager, Crewing Manager) International and national standards Training Department Introduction and changes in the international and national standards Demand-supply analysis Training Department, Marketing Analysis of the training demand based on the supply gap of training providers, trainees’ specific needs Competency gap analysis Training Department Analysis of the gap in the knowledge, skills and competence (in general) of the learning clients due to technological, socio-economic and other factors 2.2.1 Needs Analysis A “Needs Analysis” documents the initial phase of the course design and development which is used in order to determine whether the undertaking is worthwhile considering the limited resources or in choosing which training courses or program is to prioritise. The Needs Analysis must determine the following as inputs during the initial planning phase of course design and development. Training outcomes Learning outcomes Intended audience or learners Expected training or course duration Key topics Recommended references 2.3 2.3. Phases of Course Design and Development The Needs Analysis, as part of the initial planning, is the first stage of course design and development. The succeeding stages are cyclical that only stopped when agreed that the course becomes OBSOLETE due to external and internal developments (such as issues in profitability and changes in standards.) The figure below shows the phases of the course design and development. Course Design and Development Process The table shown below indicates the phases in the design and development of a course including the responsible person(s) and expected output(s). Table 4.

Writing the Learning Outcome The learning outcome must: Reflect what the learner must be able to do from the topic discussion; Measurable and capable of being assessed; Learner-centric; and Derived from the training outcomes. 3.3.1 Anatomy of the training objective and learning outcome Training objective and learning outcome must be constructed in the manner as shown below. Anatomy of a training/course outcome Table 6. Difference between training outcomes and learning outcomes Training outcomes Learning outcomes Overall outcomes upon completion of the training course or program Specific outcomes upon completion of the topic Define assessment method and standards Define the assessment criteria Attainment is measured by summative assessment Attainment is measured by both formative and summative assessments 3.3.2 Verb taxonomy The taxonomy of verbs refers to the classification thinking skills required to be demonstrated at the end of the teaching-learning activity (outcome). It is important during the design and development process that the verb used is appropriate to its taxonomy vis-à-vis the required competences, KUPs and other requirements as determined during the Needs Analysis. The following tables outline the verbs that can be used in constructing the training outcomes and learning outcomes. The list is not exhaustive; therefore, the course designer and developer must be warned of limiting himself or herself into them. Table 7. Verb taxonomy Order of thinking skills1 List of verbs Explanation Create assemble, construct, create, design, develop, generate, plan, prepare, write Produce new or original work Evaluate appraise, argue, assess, criticise, describe, evaluate, explain, judge, interpret, relate Justify a stand or decision Analyze analyze, breakdown, calculate, compute, compare and contrast, differentiate, distinguish, identify, outline, relate, select, separate, solve Draw connection among ideas Apply apply, calculate, compute, demonstrate, illustrate, interpret, manipulate, modify, operate, predict, prepare, produce, relate, sketch, solve, use, write Use information in new situations Understand classify, convert, describe, discuss, distinguish, explain, express, give examples, identity, locate, paraphrase, recognise, rewrite, select, summarise Explain ideas or concepts Know arrange, choose, define, describe, identify, label, list, match, name, order, outline, relate, select Recall facts and basic concepts Table 8.

(1981): Speak to the learner – learning outcome should address what the learner will know or be able to do at the completion of the course; Measurable – learning outcome must indicate how the learning will be assessed; Applicable – learning outcome should emphasise ways in which the learner is likely to use the knowledge or skills gained; Realistic – all learners who complete the activity or course satisfactorily should be able to demonstrate the knowledge or skills addressed in the outcome; Time-bound – the learning outcome should set a deadline by which knowledge or skills should be acquired; Transparent – should be easily understood by the learner; and Transferable – should address the knowledge and skills that will be used by the learner in the wide variety of contexts. The following also indicates the qualities of a good learning outcome: Specific – the learning outcome is clear on what is the actual performance to be expected; learning outcome does not combine two performances; Realistic – not aspirational; and Indicates useful mode of assessment.

Instructional Materials Design and Development", " 4 Chapter 4. Course Development The course development process is the actual authoring of the course package which contains the following: Contents of a course package The course development phase is the most time consuming in the course design and development process involving a series of content creation and revision. It is therefore very important to carefully plan, execute and monitor the activities related to it. Project management for course development Course development process flow 4.1 4.1. Development of the Course Plan Important note: Course designers and developers must be reminded to NOT “follow blindly” the IMO Model Course in designing and developing the courses. The primary objective of the model courses is to assist in the process. The course designers and developer are free to deviate from the model course as long the international (STCW Code) and national standards and the client’s requirements are met. 4.1.1 Course Framework Course framework is the organised plan for the whole course. It outlines, among others, what the course contains, how it is going to teach and what is the mode of assessment. For courses requiring the approval of MARINA, the Course Framework is provided by them. Everything is copied in toto, except for the teaching facilities which must be tailored with what is existing in the Training Academy. Table 9. Elements of the course framework Elements Description Scope Provides the extent of the topics or subject matter the course includes Training outcome Outlines overall outcomes upon the completion of the training course or program Entry standards Provides the requirements for qualifications to be allowed to enrol in the course Course certificate Describes the certificate the trainee will receive upon completion of the training course or program Course intake limitation Provides limitations of the number of trainees in one class Staff requirements Outlines the requirements (minimum qualification) for instructors, assessors and supervisors Assessment Describe the modes of assessment and the grading scheme Teaching facilities Outlines the needed facilities, equipment and materials for the course delivery and assessment 4.1.1.1 Writing a good Course Scope The scope includes the elements outlined below. It may be written in a compressed, single paragraph form or in multiple paragraphs provided that it is written clearly and concisely, providing each information in a single sentence, as possible. Course content: 1. What is the content of the course? 2. What is the applicable STCW Table of competence and chapter? Course delivery: How is the course delivered and what are the teaching-learning activities? Learning objectives: What is the expected outcome of the course in relation to the work, career or professional development? Assessment: What is mode of assessment? 4.1.1.2 Writing an assessment description In writing assessment description in the course framework, the following must be taken into account: provides the mode and methods of assessment; clear and transparent; and incorporates column 4 of corresponding Table of competence in the STCW Code. 4.1.1.3 Course Outline and Timetable Course outline provides the summary of topics contained in the course and their time allocation. For courses requiring the approval of MARINA, the course outline is already provided except for the time allocation of the assessment which is determined after the assessment design and development. Course timetable is the organisation of topics according to the order of the content delivery which includes: when the particular topic is to be delivered; when are exercises and other classroom tasks happen; and when the assessment takes place. 4.1.2 Course Syllabus The course syllabus captures the learning outcomes of each topic as presented in the learning outcome. It must include the following: Topics and the learning outcomes; Reference or bibliography; and Teaching aid. 4.1.3 Instructor’s Guide The primary objective of the Instructor’s Guide (IG) to aid the instructor in facilitating the course by providing the teaching and learning activities (TLA). The description of modes and methods of assessment “as”, “for” and “of” learning is also provided. Course designer and developer must be mindful that there are different methods and techniques for delivering the course in an effective and efficient manner. In writing the teaching and learning activities, the course developer must balance between too rigid instruction and deficient one. In other words, the IG must be specific but allows certain flexibility for the instructor. Table 10. Writing the teaching and learning activity Deficient Balanced Too rigid Lacks in detail or clarity; superficial entries Clear instructions but not too rigid to allow the instructor to employ his or her techniques to ensure effective learning The instructor is unable to adapt with the realities in the classroom – e.g. learner’s ability Incomplete instructions The teaching and learning activity has a very clear, sequential steps for course delivery Contains many unnecessary details, especially not those not related to the teaching-learning activity Outcomes-Based Teaching and Learning 4.1.4 Phases of instruction The IG must be planned and laid-out in a systematic and methodological manner to ensure that when carefully followed results into an effective and efficient teaching and learning. In developing the IG, either the three phases of instruction (IBC or ABC) or the ‘Gagné’s Nine Events of Instructions’ must be used – the comparison of which is outlined below. 4.1.4.1 IBC/ABC Introduction (Activation) - Establish the environment for learning by activating the interest of the trainees to the topic Body - Facilitate the learning by using different methods and techniques for teaching and learning Conclusion - Provide concluding activity 4.1.4.2 Gagné’s Nine Events of Instructions Gain the attention of the trainees (students) - Presents stimulus for learning to ensure that trainees are prepared for learning Inform the students of the objectives - State the learning outcomes (and, as appropriate, the assessment method) Stimulate recall of prior learning - Facilitate recapitulation of prior learning and relate them to the succeeding discussion Present the content - Present the topic using different methods and techniques to ensure effective learning Provide learning guidance - Provide guidance for learning such as examples, case studies, concept mapping, etc. Elicit performance (practice) - Allowing the trainees to process new knowledge and skills Provide feedback - Provide immediate feedback Assess performance - Conduct assessment (assessment ‘for’ and ‘as’ learning) Enhance retention and transfer to the job - Provide concluding activity Table 11.

Enhance retention and transfer to the job 4.1.4.3 Writing on how to start a lesson In deciding for the teaching and learning activities for Introduction (Activation) or the first three of Gagné’s Nine Events of Instructions’ (GNEI), Table 11 below shall guide the course developer. The list is not exhaustive and non-exclusive. The course developer must, therefore, must NOT limit himself or herself with the activities outlined. Table 12. Activities for starting a lesson Activities Description Suchman’s Inquiry The trainees are to ask questions answerable by YES or NO by the instructor that must lead into realisation about what the topic would be. Recapitulation of prior learning Ask questions in order for the trainees to recall prior learning (alternatively, conduct diagnostic assessment); relate prior learning to the topic to be discussed Relate news (current events) Relate current events to the topic; Read a news story or show a news clip Historical narrative Relate a chronological narrative that must trigger “why” or “how” it is so in relation to the topic to be discussed Outline Trainees is to create an outline in relation to the topic which is to be revisited at the end or near the end of the discussion Post-It Use Post-It in asking the trainees examples, agree/disagree and other responses Pose a problem Pose a problem and ask the trainees how it might be solved; Do not provide the solution immediately; revisit the problem after the discussion Word cloud/ vocabulary Present the terminologies that are related in the discussion 4.1.4.4 Outcomes-Based Teaching and Learning (OBTL) Activities The following must be taken into account in writing the middle phase (or phases, in case of using the GNEI method) or instruction. Constructive alignment must be followed in deciding what activities to conduct during instruction taking into account, first, the learning outcomes, then, the assessment method/s. Activities must be appropriate based on the: Content Type of learner Duration Availability of resources Activities must be learner-centred as opposed to being instructor-centred. Activities must aid the learning process. Otherwise, they are just waste of time. Below provides a useful guide in choosing the teaching and learning activity based on teaching and learning strategy. The list is not exhaustive and non-exclusive. Table 13.

DBT incorporated in the phases of instruction 4.2 4.2. Instructional Materials Design and Development Instructional materials (IMs) that needs to be designed and developed include: Case studies Classroom activities – specific activities as indicated in the IG need to have an activity sheet detailing how the activity is to be conducted Handouts PowerPoint presentation or related material (Canva, Keynote, Prezi, Google Slides, etc.) Instructional materials to be used for instruction must be indicated in the IG. Other IMs not listed above include: Calculator Manuals Published diagrams, charts, posters, etc. (such as published by IMO and Maritime Progress Ltd.) Software Programs Tools and equipment Videos 4.2.1 PowerPoint presentation as an instructional material In designing and developing PPT presentation as instructional material, the following must be taken into account: The presentation must be designed and developed to AID the delivery and to ASSIST the instructor. It must NOT be the primary source of information making the instructor redundant. It must PREVENT the instructor from just reading the slides.This can be achieved by: Avoiding text-dense slides. If the slides contained only texts, the general rule is to have 6 to 8 words per line and 4 to 6 lines per slide; Long text is only appropriate when including an excerpt (whether from law, historical narrative, news clippings, etc.); The content on the slides must be based on the LEARNING OUTCOMES. The slide must contain only ENOUGH STIMULUS for instruction. Content must be presented in a logical manner. A slide filled with unnecessary details especially if presented in illogical manner will lead the learner astray. Use emphasis to highlight important contents but do it in uniform, logical manner. Use italics, bold and colour. Avoid using underline. Use sans serif fonts such as Arial, Calibre, Tahoma and Segoe UI. Use only up to two font style. Acceptable serif fonts include Cambria and Book Antiqua. Avoid using fancy font style such as Comic Sans, Lucida Calligraphy and Vivaldi. Use animation and sound sparingly and only when necessary. When printed, the slide must not have overlapping content. The exception is when the slides is used EXCLUSIVELY for self-learning and animations and overlapping contents are necessary.

Course Finalization, Implementation and Monitoring, and Evaluation 5.1 5.1. Course Finalization The course finalisation process ensures the quality of the designed and developed courses before implanting them. While the perfection cannot be achieved or is a continuous process, the conduct of course finalisation must ensure to rid glaring and obvious errors or inaccuracies. Course Finalization Process 5.1.1 Review by the SME The Subject Matter Expert (SME) or the assigned assessor, in reviewing the course must check the following below. The reviewer must not be involved in the design and development process. Factual accuracy and validity of the course plan and instructional materials; Constructive alignment of training and learning outcomes, teaching and learning activities and assessment activities; Sufficiency of the course materials designed and developed; Grammar and spelling errors; and Overall quality of the training or course program. All corrections and observations must be revised accordingly. 5.1.2 Pilot Testing The conduct of the course pilot testing is to provide another validation of the course or training program. The instructor to conduct the pilot testing must not be part of the design and development process. Specifically, the pilot testing checks for the following: Validity of the allotted time; Acceptance for the intended training recipient; and Efficiency of the course delivery. 5.2 5.2. Course Implementation In ensuring that the courses are delivered as designed and developed, the following are must be taken into mind: Anticipating and resolving constraints during the course delivery; Ensuring that the instructor to deliver the course has the technical expertise, knowledge in teaching and learning effectively and is trained and briefed regarding the course; Ensuring that the training room or instruction area is conducive for learning; Ensuring the efficient coordination between personnel involved in the course delivery including the assessment part; Extending support services to the trainees to address their immediate concerns, especially those related to the course delivery; and Extending support such as in preparation of the training room, course materials, tools, equipment, etc. for the conduct of the course. 5.3 5.3. Course Monitoring Continuous monitoring ensures that course implementation is according to the planned and desired outcome. The figure below outlines how oversight is structured in monitoring the course delivery. Oversight diagram for course implementation 5.3.1 Course monitoring system Course monitoring is just one part of the course monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E). In this manual, course evaluation is treated separately for the purpose of ensuring all areas are covered. The M&amp;E system covers three areas namely outcomes, intermediate results and resources as described in the figure below. Before the course is to be conducted and in the final review and approval in the course development phase, the course M&amp;E framework is to be prepared by the RND and reviewed and approved by the COO and the Department Heads. The course M&amp;E framework contains the following: Components of the course M&amp;E system Indicator Definition Baseline Target Data Source Frequency Responsible Person Reporting Course M&amp;E System 5.4 5.4. Review and Evaluation The following are inputs in the course review: Course plan and instructional materials; Instructor’s comments and suggestions; New international and national standards; and New technology, discoveries, etc. During the conduct of the course review, the assigned subject matter expert (course developer, instructor or assessor) checks for the accuracy and validity of the course materials and focuses in updating and enhancing the course materials. A course evaluation is the holistic examination of courses which includes the results from course review as an input. The results in each component of the Course M&amp;E System are collated and prepares (or assign the preparation of) the course evaluation report in coordination with the department heads, management and the subject matter experts. A Course Review Committee meeting is to be held subjecting the report for scrutiny and outlining the action plan including course revision. Major course revision which affects more than 50% of the course material must undergo with the same process as course design and course development before final review and approval.
