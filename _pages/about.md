Hello! I am **Aries** and this is my personal page to share some of my works. I hope to transition as an economist with interests in macroeconomics, labour economics, economic development and public policy.

I was a seafarer for a short period as a cadet and officer onboard general cargo ships with usual trade in the East Asia and the eastern coast of South America (from Costa Rica to Chile). After that, I work as an instructor for my alma mater until the program was discontinued and the last batch completed their academic requirements. My last works typically is still in the area of maritime education and training with managerial roles in the later part.

# Hobbies and interests

## Reading

I love reading newspapers (<span style="color:red;">**in paper form**</span>). (Especially with a good cup of coffee and, maybe, a slice of cake.) 

These days, I read mostly non-fiction. But I also read classics and young adult fiction. I try to review the books I read which you can find on my <a href="https://aeroles.substack.com/" target="_blank">Substack</a>.

## Games

I enjoyed playing <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/cities-skylines-ii/about" target="_blank">City Skylines 2</a> building cities (and districts) and detailing. On mobile, I play <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.supercell.clashofclans&hl=en&pli=1" target ="_blank">Class of Clans</a>.

## Music

Classical music mostly fill my playlists. But I also enjoy listening to pop, rock, OPM, jazz. (Basically, anything.)

## Podcasts
